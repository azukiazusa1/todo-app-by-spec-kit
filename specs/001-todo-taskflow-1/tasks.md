## Dependencies
**Critical Dependencies:**
- Setup (T001-T005) before all other phases
- All tests (T006-T022) before implementation (T023-T051)
- T027 (storage service) blocks T028 (task service)
- T028 blocks T029, T031
- T031 blocks T038-T040 (page components)
- T035-T037 (components) before T039 (tasks page)

**Parallel Safe Groups:**
- Setup: T003, T004, T005 can run together
- Contract Tests: T006-T008 can run together
- Data Model Tests: T009-T011 can run together
- Integration Tests: T012-T022 can run together
- Data Types: T023-T026 can run together
- Components: T035-T037 can run together
- Polish: T047, T048, T051 can run together

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Test Phase (after T001-T005 complete):
```bash
# Launch all contract tests simultaneously
Task: "Contract test for TaskService interface in tests/contract/task-service.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test for StorageService interface in tests/contract/storage-service.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test for UI hooks interfaces in tests/contract/ui-hooks.test.ts"

# Launch all integration tests simultaneously
Task: "Homepage navigation test in tests/integration/homepage.test.tsx"
Task: "Tasks page functionality test in tests/integration/tasks-page.test.tsx"  
Task: "Task detail operations test in tests/integration/task-detail.test.tsx"
# ... (continue with T015-T022)
```

### Implementation Phase (after all tests failing):
```bash
# Launch all data model tasks simultaneously
Task: "Task entity and related types in lib/types/task.ts"
Task: "Filter and selection state types in lib/types/filter.ts"
Task: "Page-specific state types in lib/types/page-state.ts"
Task: "User preferences types in lib/types/preferences.ts"
```

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All contracts (3) have corresponding tests (T006-T008)
- [x] All major entities (Task, Filter, PageState, Preferences) have model tasks (T023-T026)
- [x] All tests (T006-T022) come before implementation (T023-T051)
- [x] Parallel tasks ([P]) are truly independent - different files/components
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] All 12 quickstart scenarios have corresponding integration tests
- [x] TDD cycle enforced: failing tests required before implementation

## Notes
- **[P] tasks** = Different files, no dependencies - can execute in parallel
- **File path specificity**: Each task includes exact file location for implementation
- **TDD enforcement**: All tests must be written and failing before moving to implementation
- **Next.js App Router**: Uses modern file-based routing with app/ directory structure
- **Tailwind CSS 4.0**: Requires CSS First Configuration setup in globals.css
- **LocalStorage focus**: No backend/API calls - pure frontend implementation
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance enforced through dedicated tests and implementation tasks
