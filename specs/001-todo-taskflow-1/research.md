# Research: TaskFlow TODO Management Application

## Technical Research Findings

### Next.js App Router Architecture
**Decision**: Use Next.js 14+ App Router with TypeScript for the frontend framework
**Rationale**: 
- App Router provides modern React patterns with server components
- Built-in TypeScript support with excellent developer experience
- File-based routing aligns with TODO app's page structure (dashboard, settings, etc.)
- Client-side rendering suitable for localStorage-based persistence
- Excellent performance optimizations out-of-the-box

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Vite + React: More lightweight but requires manual routing setup
- Create React App: Deprecated and lacks modern optimizations
- Pure HTML/JS: Would require extensive manual state management

### Styling Strategy
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS 4.0+ with CSS First Configurations
**Rationale**:
- CSS First Configurations provide better performance and developer experience
- Configuration managed in CSS files instead of JavaScript (tailwind.config.js)
- Better tree-shaking and build optimization in v4.0+
- Native CSS cascade layers support for better style organization
- Utility-first approach still enables rapid prototyping
- Built-in responsive design utilities and accessibility features
- Improved dark mode and theme customization

**Alternatives considered**:
- Tailwind CSS 3.x with JS config: Legacy approach, less optimized
- CSS Modules: More verbose, slower development
- Styled Components: Runtime overhead, SSR complexity

### Data Persistence Pattern
**Decision**: Custom LocalStorage hook with TypeScript interfaces
**Rationale**:
- LocalStorage provides 5-10MB storage suitable for TODO data
- Synchronous API simplifies state management
- No network dependencies (offline-first requirement)
- Browser support across all target platforms
- Easy JSON serialization for structured data

**Alternatives considered**:
- IndexedDB: Overkill for simple TODO data structure
- SessionStorage: Data loss on tab close
- In-memory only: Data loss on page refresh

### State Management Architecture
**Decision**: React useState + useEffect with custom hooks
**Rationale**:
- Built-in React patterns, no external dependencies
- Sufficient for single-user TODO app scope
- Custom hooks can encapsulate localStorage logic
- Easy testing with React Testing Library

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux Toolkit: Over-engineering for simple TODO operations
- Zustand: Additional dependency not justified
- Context API: Performance overhead for frequent updates

### Component Architecture
**Decision**: Functional components with TypeScript interfaces
**Rationale**:
- Modern React patterns with hooks
- TypeScript provides compile-time type safety
- Easier testing and debugging
- Better performance with React optimizations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Class components: Legacy pattern, verbose syntax
- JavaScript only: Missing type safety for complex TODO data

### Keyboard Shortcuts Implementation
**Decision**: Custom useKeyboard hook with event listeners
**Rationale**:
- Direct DOM event handling for global shortcuts
- Platform detection (Windows/Mac) for modifier keys
- Easy to test and maintain
- No external dependency required

**Alternatives considered**:
- Hotkeys-js library: Additional bundle size
- Native browser shortcuts: Limited customization

### Accessibility Implementation
**Decision**: Tailwind accessibility utilities + semantic HTML + ARIA labels
**Rationale**:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirement
- Tailwind provides sr-only, focus utilities
- Semantic HTML improves screen reader experience
- ARIA labels for complex interactions (bulk selection)

**Alternatives considered**:
- External a11y library: Adds complexity
- Manual accessibility: Error-prone, time-intensive

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: React Testing Library + Vitest for component and integration testing
**Rationale**:
- Vitest is faster than Jest with native ESM support
- Better TypeScript integration and performance
- Vite-compatible testing environment for consistency
- Modern testing features (concurrent tests, watch mode)
- Testing Library promotes accessibility-focused tests
- Integration tests can verify localStorage persistence
- Excellent developer experience with HMR-like test updates

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest: Slower, requires additional configuration for ESM
- Cypress: Overkill for single-page TODO app
- Enzyme: Deprecated, not compatible with modern React

### Performance Optimization
**Decision**: React.memo for list components, useMemo for filtering/sorting
**Rationale**:
- Task lists can contain hundreds of items
- Search and filtering operations need optimization
- Bulk operations (50-item limit) require efficient rendering

**Alternatives considered**:
- Virtual scrolling: Complex implementation, not needed for 50-item limit
- External optimization library: Additional dependency

## Architecture Decisions Summary

1. **Framework**: Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4.0+
2. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.0+ with CSS First Configurations (CSS file-based config)
3. **Data Layer**: Custom LocalStorage hooks with TypeScript interfaces
4. **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
5. **Components**: Functional components with TypeScript props
6. **Testing**: React Testing Library + Vitest (modern, fast testing)
7. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML + ARIA + Tailwind a11y utilities
8. **Performance**: React.memo + useMemo for list optimizations

All technical unknowns have been resolved. Ready to proceed to Phase 1 design.
